            <p>Classes and Objects are basic concepts of Object Oriented Programming which revolve around the real life entities.
                A class is a user defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.
                It represents the set of properties or methods that are common to all objects of one type.
                A class can contain any of the following variable types.

            </p>
            <u>
               <li>Local variables</li> 

               <li>Instance variables</li>

               <li>Class variables</li>
            </u>
            <p>Variables defined inside methods, constructors or blocks are called local variables. 
               The variable will be declared and initialized within the method and the variable will be destroyed when the method has completed.
               Variables defined inside methods, constructors or blocks are called local variables.
               The variable will be declared and initialized within the method and the variable will be destroyed when the method has completed.
               Class variables are variables declared within a class, outside any method, with the static keyword.

                class <class_name>{  
                 field;  
                 method;}  </p>
            <h4>Objects</h4>
            <p>Object consists of :</p>
            <u>
                <li>State </li>
                <li>Behavior</li>
                <li>Identity</li>
            </u>
            <p> 
                State is is represented by attributes of an object. It also reflects the properties of an object.
                Behavior is represented by methods of an object. It also reflects the response of an object with other objects.
                Identity gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with other objects.

                    Let's take an example of developing a pet management system, specially meant for dogs.
                    You will need various information about the dogs like different breeds of the dogs, the age, size, etc.
                    You need to model real-life beings, i.e., dogs into software entities.
                    Some of the differences you might have listed out maybe breed, age, size, color, etc. If you think for a minute, these differences are also some common characteristics shared by these dogs. 
                    These characteristics (breed, age, size, color) can form a data members for your object.
                    Next, list out the common behaviors of these dogs like sleep, sit, eat, etc. 
                    So these will be the actions of our software objects.
                    Here the class name is Dog.The data members are breed,size,age,color can vary for each object.However all the of them have 
                    same functions which is eat,sleep,sit and run.
